# Kafka_demo
This project demonstrates a high-level implementation of real-time API hit count tracking using Kafka, integrated with a Flask-based Python application. The system captures API interactions (GET, POST, PUT requests) in real-time, processes them via Kafka, and displays the results on a live dashboard.
